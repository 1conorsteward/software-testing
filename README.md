# software-testing
A suite of functional classes and JUnit tests for those classes along with a report.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Creating functional and secure software includes many requirements to be thorough. Clearly define the functional requirements of your software by understanding the problem it's supposed to solve and the needs of its users. Consider factors such as usability, performance, scalability, and security. Incorporate security into the design phase of your software development process. Use secure coding practices, follow industry-standard security guidelines, and consider potential security threats and vulnerabilities. Write clean, maintainable code that follows best practices and coding standards. Use secure coding techniques to mitigate common security risks such as injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and authentication flaws. Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure that your software functions as intended and is free of defects and vulnerabilities. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and security testing. Implement secure deployment practices to ensure that your software is deployed in a secure environment. Use encryption, access controls, and other security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Monitor your software in production to detect and respond to security incidents and performance issues. Stay informed about new security threats and vulnerabilities, and regularly update your software with patches and security fixes.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Conduct user research to gain insights into the needs, preferences, and pain points of your target audience. This can involve surveys, interviews, user testing, and analyzing user feedback. Break down user needs into user stories or use cases that describe specific features or functionality from the user's perspective. Prioritize these user stories based on importance and feasibility. Adopt an iterative development approach where you build and release software incrementally, gathering feedback from users at each stage. This allows you to incorporate user feedback and make adjustments as needed. Test your software with real users to evaluate its usability and effectiveness in meeting their needs. Identify areas for improvement and iterate on the design based on user feedback. Continuously gather feedback from users, analyze usage data, and make iterative improvements to your software to better align with user needs and preferences over time.
How do I approach designing software?
  As before, start by understanding the requirements of your software system, including functional requirements, performance requirements, scalability requirements, and other quality attributes. Break down the system into manageable components or modules that represent different functional areas or features. Define the interfaces and interactions between these components. Select the appropriate architectural style or pattern for your software system based on its requirements and constraints. Common architectural styles include monolithic architecture, microservices architecture, client-server architecture, and event-driven architecture. Apply design patterns and principles such as SOLID principles, separation of concerns, and design by contract to ensure that your software is modular, maintainable, and extensible. Create prototypes or mockups to validate your design decisions and get feedback from stakeholders. Iterate on the design based on feedback and lessons learned. Document your software design using diagrams, documentation, and other artifacts to communicate your design decisions effectively with stakeholders, developers, and other team members. Continuously refactor and improve your software design as you gain more insights, receive feedback, and encounter new requirements or constraints. Keep the design flexible and adaptable to changes over time.
